# The Open Source Survey

[design]: https://github.com/github/open-source-survey/blob/master/design-principles.md

We've run the largest survey of the open source community to date, the results of are an open dataset for us all to use and learn from. We hope the dataset informs some of the most pressing questions about open source software, the people that create it, their experience, and their relationship to the industry that depends on it.

Learn more about the [survey design][design] and the [topics we're studying](https://github.com/github/open-source-survey/blob/master/survey-topics.md).

## Why is GitHub doing this?

At GitHub our goal is to help everyone build better software. We believe open source code, communities, and principles create better software. As an industry, we know a lot about how open source software is created but very little about the people who create and use it. Are they professional developers, students, or hobbyists?

To build better software, then we need a software community where anyone, regardless of what they look like or where they come from, can participate. This survey will help us see how we, as a community, are doing.

## Open data

Open source is bigger than any company or community. The dataset is released under [CC0-1.0](#license) for anyone to use and learn from.

## Contributors

This survey is primarily designed and implemented by GitHub:

- [@franniez](https://github.com/franniez) -  Data and social scientist at GitHub. New to open source but not to studying people or movements, she's done extensive survey research in Washington D.C, from inside the ivory tower, and within the technology sector. 
- [@arfon](https://github.com/arfon) - Program Manager for Open Source Data at GitHub. A lapsed academic with a passion for new models of scientific collaboration, he's used big telescopes to [study dust in space](http://www.arfon.org/thesis), built sequencing pipelines in [Cambridge](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/) and have engaged millions of people in online citizen science by co-founding the [Zooniverse](http://zooniverse.org).
- [@mlinksva](https://github.com/mlinksva) - Open Source Maven at GitHub. A lapsed engineer and non-lawyer with a passion for increasing the efficacy and scope of open production and policy, he is an advisor/director/volunteer for various open initiatives and was previously a manager and technologist at Creative Commons.

This isn't a solo effort for us, these awesome individuals and organizations have helped us design this survey:

- [@annafil](https://github.com/annafil) - Postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, Institute for Software Research
- [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/)
